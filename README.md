#  My Portfolio

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me
I’m a positive and motivated individual with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, developed through my academic background. I am highly organized, detail-oriented, and structured. I enjoy working with people and solving problems.
I hold a Master’s degree from Purvanchal University, India, and I’m currently transitioning into a career as a Software Automation Engineer. I’m actively building my skills through a combination of online and in-person courses, focusing on software testing tools, techniques, and hands-on practice with web applications designed for learning.
My goal is to apply this knowledge in real-world testing environments, gain practical experience, and grow into a mid-level software tester within the next two years.
